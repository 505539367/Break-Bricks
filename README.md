# Break-Bricks

Rule:
The player moves a wall left or right to hit a BALL. The game's objective is to eliminate all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the BALL. But, if the ball hits the bottom ENCLOSURE, the player loses and the game ends! To win the game, all the BRICKS must be eliminated.
